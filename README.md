## 🎯 Business Problem
Acquiring new customers costs 5x more than retaining existing ones. This project provides a proactive solution by:
- **Predicting Churn** with 98.5% precision.
- **Quantifying Risk** by merging probability with Customer Lifetime Value (LTV).
- **Providing Transparency** through SHAP values to explain *why* a customer is leaving.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Modeling:** XGBoost Classifier with SMOTE for class imbalance.
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud.
- **Analysis:** SHAP (Explainable AI), Plotly (Interactivity).
- **Automation:** Python-based feature engineering pipeline.

## 📈 Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** 98.55%
- **Recall (Churned):** 0.98 (Essential for identifying every at-risk account).
- **Precision:** 0.99
